## 📌 What is this project about?

This is a little side project I decided to take on — tracking Lionel Messi’s movement and involvement against Getafe during the 2018/19 La Liga season.

There's more to football than just goals and assists, so I wanted to dive deeper into things like:

- ✅ Dribbles completed  
- 🧠 Successful & unsuccessful passes 
- 📊 Heatmaps & movement tracking  
- ⚡ Messi's role in buildup play  

The idea is to get a better feel for the full picture of Messi's performance — especially when he's not directly on the scoresheet.


💭 Why this match?

This wasn’t a big headline game — and that’s the point. I wanted to see what Messi looks like in a regular La Liga fixture, against a team like Getafe that often plays compact and defensively.

It’s the kind of game where his subtle movements, off-ball intelligence, and creative influence really show if you pay close attention😉

🚀 What’s next?

This is just the beginning. I'm currently working on a broader project analysing how two rival teams produced contrasting results across different competitions
